# ChatCha: Decentralized AI Agent Platform 

## Overview

ChatCha is a decentralized AI agent platform where users can get their queries answered with data storage and verifiability provided by Filecoin/IPFS using Storacha. This project is built for the **Hot AI Integrations, Hotter Storage \& Spicy AI Collaboration with Storacha Data Storage** Bounty, demonstrating decentralized data storage, real-time data sharing, and analysis.


## What ChatCha Does

This project uses multiple specialized AI agents to answer user queries based on whether the user is asking for real-time latest data or information from various research papers. The multi-agent architecture ensures comprehensive and accurate responses.

## ü§ñ Agents Used

### 1. Web Search Agent üåê

- Searches the web in real-time
- Provides up-to-date information on current events and topics
- Stores search results and processing data in dedicated Storacha space


### 2. Scholar Agent üéì

- Searches various articles and research papers
- Provides academic and research-backed information
- Maintains its own Storacha space for scholarly data storage


### 3. Analyzer Agent 

- Takes output/data from both Web Search \& Scholar Agents (i.e. from their spaces)
- Summarizes and synthesizes information from multiple sources
- Delivers concise, coherent final responses to users
- Stores analysis data in a separate Storacha space


## Storacha Integrations üî•
### 1. Unique Storacha Spaces

ChatCha creates 4 distinct Storacha Spaces:

- **Web Agent Space**: Where web agent stores its data
- **Scholar Agent Space**: Where scholar agent stores its data
- **Main Space**: Where combined data from both web \& scholar agents is stored
- **Analyzer Agent Space**: Where analyzer agent stores its data


### 2. Storage \& Retrieval of Artifacts

For each query, ChatCha stores four key artifacts:

- `input` ‚Äì Original prompt provided to the agent
- `output` ‚Äì Final result data
- `conversation` ‚Äì Chain of Thought reasoning
- `metadata` ‚Äì Timestamp, model info, etc.
